abstract: Glia are known to play important roles in the brain, the gut, and around
  the sciatic nerve. While the gut has its own specialized nervous system, other viscera
  are innervated solely by autonomic nerves. The functions of glia that accompany
  autonomic innervation are not well known, even though they are one of the most abundant
  cell types in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we focused on non‐myelinating
  Schwann cells in the spleen, spleen glia. The spleen is a major immune organ innervated
  by the sympathetic nervous system, which modulates immune function. This interaction
  is known as neuroimmune communication. We establish that spleen glia can be visualized
  using both immunohistochemistry for S100B and GFAP and with a reporter mouse. Spleen
  glia ensheath sympathetic axons and are localized to the lymphocyte‐rich white pulp
  areas of the spleen. We sequenced the spleen glia transcriptome and identified genes
  that are likely involved in axonal ensheathment and communication with both nerves
  and immune cells. Spleen glia express receptors for neurotransmitters made by sympathetic
  axons (adrenergic, purinergic, and Neuropeptide Y), and also cytokines, chemokines,
  and their receptors that may communicate with immune cells in the spleen. We also
  established similarities and differences between spleen glia and other glial types.
  While all glia share many genes in common, spleen glia differentially express genes
  associated with immune responses, including genes involved in cytokine‐cytokine
  receptor interactions, phagocytosis, and the complement cascade. Thus, spleen glia
  are a unique glial type, physically and transcriptionally poised to participate
  in neuroimmune communication in the spleen. Spleen glia maintain tight associations
  with splenic nerves and come in close contact with immune cells. Spleen glia express
  genes required for communication with nerves and immune cells. Spleen glia are a
  transcriptionally unique glial type.
