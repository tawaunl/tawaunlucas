abstract: Obesity is associated with chronic peripheral inflammation, is a risk factor
  for stroke, and causes increased infarct sizes. To characterize how obesity increases
  infarct size, we fed a high-fat diet to wild-type C57BL/6J mice for either 6 weeks
  or 15 weeks and then induced distal middle cerebral artery strokes. We found that
  infarct expansion happened late after stroke. There were no differences in cortical
  neuroinflammation (astrogliosis, microgliosis, or pro-inflammatory cytokines) either
  prior to or 10 h after stroke, and also no differences in stroke size at 10 h. However,
  by 3 days after stroke, animals fed a high-fat diet had a dramatic increase in microgliosis
  and astrogliosis that was associated with larger strokes and worsened functional
  recovery. RNA sequencing revealed a dramatic increase in inflammatory genes in the
  high-fat diet-fed animals 3 days after stroke that were not present prior to stroke.
  Genetic pathways unique to diet-induced obesity were primarily related to adaptive
  immunity, extracellular matrix components, cell migration, and vasculogenesis. The
  late appearance of neuroinflammation and infarct expansion indicates that there
  may be a therapeutic window between 10 and 36 h after stroke where inflammation
  and obesity-specific transcriptional programs could be targeted to improve outcomes
  in people with obesity and stroke.
