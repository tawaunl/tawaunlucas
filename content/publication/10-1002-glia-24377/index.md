abstract: Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ischemic stroke, which is a leading cause
  of death and long‐term disability. Understanding the exact cellular signaling pathways
  that initiate and propagate neuroinflammation after stroke will be critical for
  developing immunomodulatory stroke therapies. In particular, the precise mechanisms
  of inflammatory signaling in the clinically relevant hyperacute period, hours after
  stroke, have not been elucidated. We used the RiboTag technique to obtain microglia
  and astrocyte‐derived mRNA transcripts in a hyperacute (4 h) and acute (3 days)
  period after stroke, as these two cell types are key modulators of acute neuroinflammation.
  Microglia initiated a rapid response to stroke at 4 h by adopting an inflammatory
  profile associated with the recruitment of immune cells. The hyperacute astrocyte
  profile was marked by stress response genes and transcription factors, such as Fos
  and Jun, involved in pro‐inflammatory pathways such as TNF‐α. By 3 days, microglia
  shift to a proliferative state and astrocytes strengthen their inflammatory response.
  The astrocyte pro‐inflammatory response at 3 days is partially driven by the upregulation
  of the transcription factors C/EBPβ, Spi1, and Rel, which comprise 25% of upregulated
  transcription factor‐target interactions. Surprisingly, few sex differences across
  all groups were observed. Expression and log2 fold data for all sequenced genes
  are available on a user‐friendly website for researchers to examine gene changes
  and generate hypotheses for stroke targets. Taken together, our data comprehensively
  describe the microglia and astrocyte‐specific translatome response in the hyperacute
  and acute period after stroke and identify pathways critical for initiating neuroinflammation.
  Microglia and astrocytes adopt an inflammatory profile by 4 h after stroke. By 3
  days, microglia shift to a proliferative state while astrocytes remain pro‐inflammatory.
