abstract: The important contribution of glia to mechanisms of injury and repair of
  the nervous system is increasingly recognized. In stark contrast to the central
  nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has a remarkable capacity
  for regeneration after injury. Schwann cells are recognized as key contributors
  to PNS regeneration, but the molecular underpinnings of the Schwann cell response
  to injury and how they interact with the inflammatory response remain incompletely
  understood. We completed bulk RNA-sequencing of Schwann cells purified acutely using
  immunopanning from the na√Øve and injured rodent sciatic nerve at 3, 5, and 7 days
  post-injury. We used qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization to assess cell purity and
  probe dataset integrity. Finally, we used bioinformatic analysis to probe Schwann
  cell-specific injury-induced modulation of cellular pathways. Our data confirm Schwann
  cell purity and validate RNAseq dataset integrity. Bioinformatic analysis identifies
  discrete modules of genes that follow distinct patterns of regulation in the 1st
  days after injury and their corresponding molecular pathways. These findings enable
  improved differentiation of myeloid and glial components of neuroinflammation after
  peripheral nerve injury and highlight novel molecular aspects of the Schwann cell
  injury response such as acute downregulation of the AGE/RAGE pathway and of secreted
  molecules Sparcl1 and Sema5a. We provide a helpful resource for further deciphering
  the Schwann cell injury response and a depth of transcriptional data that can complement
  the findings of recent single cell sequencing approaches. As more data become available
  on the response of CNS glia to injury, we anticipate that this dataset will provide
  a valuable platform for understanding key differences in the PNS and CNS glial responses
  to injury and for designing approaches to ameliorate CNS regeneration.
